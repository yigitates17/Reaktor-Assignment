# Home Page
On the home page, users can view the on-going games (WebSocket feature is not available yet) and the recent 50 games. By clicking name of any player, users can access players' profile pages.

- Total Played Game Amount
- Most Played Hand and Numbers of Each Played Hands
- Win Rate along with Total Win, Draw, Lose Numbers
- Last 20 games of the player
